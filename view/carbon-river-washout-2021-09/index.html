                    <p>Cars can't go past the Carbon River Entrance at Mt. Rainier anymore because of erosion. The road was built near the river, and a big storm made the river carry away so much soil under the road that about half of this part of the road fell into the river. This part of the road used to fit two cars side by side.</p>
                
                    <p>This picture is good to compare to the picture of the same spot from summer 2022. After just one year, erosion destroyed the rest of this section of road.</p>
