                    <p>The trail turns a sharp corner here as it goes back and forth up a steep hill. This is called a switchback.</p>
                
                    <p>The soil was too steep, loose, and slippery right here, so rangers built a short wall to protect the trail and keep hikers safe. Instead of going over the wall, hikers have to go around it. That way is safer and less steep.</p>
